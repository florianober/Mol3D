[A]  Preparations

This code needs cfitsio. Therefore, download it either from http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html 
or have a look into your favored linux distribution software archive.

Install cfitsio globally or into the directory 
above this Mol3d installation (e.g. './../cfitsio')

Intel Fortran compiler should give the best performence, but Gfortran should also
work.

-optional

This code uses OpenMP for parallelisation

[B] 
You have to (re-)compile the code:

>make new

The default compiler is Intel Fortran compiler.
You can change the compiler in the make process by

>make FC=gfortran new

For better performance we recommend to use:

>make CO=fast new

To use OpenMP:

>make CO=para new

For more options on the make process check out
>make help

[C]

Visualisation scripts are found in the 'visualize' folder. 
Python3 (matplotlib, numpy, astropy) is required.

If you have problems in running the code, please do not hesitate to ask me.

You are free to use and extend this code, but if you do so, please cite 'F. Ober 2014 (in prep)'
